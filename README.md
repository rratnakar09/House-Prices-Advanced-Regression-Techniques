The notebook "Loan_Prediction.ipynb", I have submitted this on "kaggle". I have got a public score of 0.13930 on test data with a rank of 2628. I will try to improve the score by using better feature selection, hyperparameter tuning and better model selection.
For my first submission I have followed an awesome video "Kaggle Competition - House Prices: Advanced Regression Techniques Part1" on this data set by Krish Naik and link for this video is:"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vtm35gVP8JU&list=PLZoTAELRMXVPiKOxbwaniXjHJ02bdkLWy&index=2&t=0s".
